# # Libpll-2

libpll-2 is the new official fork of libpll (https://github.com/xflouris/libpll/). It implements site repeats to speed up computations.


Please read the wiki for more information.



# Projects that are already using libpll-2
 List of projects already using libpll-2 and site repeats, and reported speedups compared with the tip pattern optimization:
 * [RAxML-NG](https://github.com/amkozlov/raxml-ng): speedup ranges between 1.2 and 1.5 
 * [ModelTest-NG](https://github.com/ddarriba/modeltest): speedup around 1.3
 * [EPA-ng](https://github.com/Pbdas/epa-ng): memory footprint reduced by 30%.


# Compilation instructions

Currently, `libpll` requires that [GNU Bison](http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)
and [Flex](http://flex.sourceforge.net/) are installed on the target system. On
a Debian-based Linux system, the two packages can be installed using the command

`apt-get install flex bison`

The library also requires that a GNU system is available as it uses several
functions (e.g. `asprintf`) which are not present in the POSIX standard.
This, however will change in the future in order to have a more portable
and cross-platform library.

The library can be compiled using either of the following two ways.

**Cloning the repo** Clone the repo and bild the executable and documentation
using the following commands.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xflouris/libpll-2.git
cd libpll-2
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install    # as root, otherwise run: sudo make install
```

When using the cloned repository version, you will also need
[autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html),
[automake](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/) and
[libtool](https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/) installed. On a Debian-based
Linux system, the packages can be installed using the command

```bash
sudo apt-get install autotools-dev autoconf libtool
```

The library will be installed on the operating system's standard paths.  For
some GNU/Linux distributions it might be necessary to add that standard path
(typically `/usr/local/lib`) to `/etc/ld.so.conf` and run `ldconfig`.

Microsoft Windows compatibility was tested with a cross-compiler and seems to
work out-of-the-box using [MingW](http://www.mingw.org/).
